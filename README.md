# Cincinnati-Zoo-Plant-Conservation-Database-Development


The project is a collaborative effort led by Dr. Valerie Pence of the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden to address the pressing need for effective conservation methods for exceptional plant species. Focused on developing online tools for conservation practitioners, this project aims to create a comprehensive database analyzing factors such as media, hormones, and freezing methods in relation to taxa. By incorporating environmental adaptation information and merging data from sources like GBIF and weather stations, the database will facilitate efficient protocol development and enhance predictability in plant conservation efforts to empower researchers within the Cincinnati Zoo and a global network of conservationists interested in conservation of exceptional plant species worldwide.![image](https://github.com/Oklein1/Cincinnati-Zoo-Plant-Conservation-Database-Development-/assets/47824495/2b50c1a2-2600-4c4b-9d00-dc9e78c7b635)
